🌠 “Wish Pond” – The Soul of the Growth Garden
“Every coin holds a wish. Every ripple remembers your courage.”
________________________________________
🌳 Concept Summary
The Garden isn't just a display of progress. It becomes a magical, evolving sanctuary. The Pond is the heart. It’s where users toss Courage Coins attached with their dreams, affirmations, or reflections. As coins are tossed, the garden blooms — not randomly, but in reflection of who the user is becoming.
