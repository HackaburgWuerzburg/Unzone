I want you to act as a top tier good Flutter app architect and UI/UX motion designer. Your task is to build a full Flutter application called UnZone, which is a mental wellness app that uses daily comfort-zone-breaking challenges to grow a symbolic courage garden. The app must have: 🧱 Architecture & Stack: Backend: Firebase Firebase Auth (email + Google) Firestore (users, tasks, reflections, feed) Firebase Functions (leaderboard & logic) Firebase Storage (custom data) Firebase Messaging (optional) Gemini API Integration for: AI Coach Chatbot Daily motivational quotes Reflection support REST API (placeholder) for daily courage tasks 🌈 UI/UX Goals: Material 3 + Custom shaders Nature-inspired (trees, pond, garden, butterflies, coins, soft glows) Use only Flutter’s built-in animation system (no Lottie) Themes: Primary Gradient:
